Below is a clean, agent-ready master prompt that (1) matches your top-graded current homepage quality, (2) fits your hybrid model (Cybersecurity + Alliance Trust Realty), and (3) forces the agent to first audit where the last agent stopped before adding anything new.

You can copy/paste this directly into Replit Agent.

REPLIT AGENT MASTER PROMPT (Hybrid Enterprise Platform)

0) Mission

You are continuing an in-progress enterprise website for:
	•	GEM Cybersecurity & Monitoring Assist (Cyber Division)
	•	Alliance Trust Realty LLC (Asset/Trust Division; Powered Partner)

The site must remain one cohesive platform (not two stitched sites).
Your output must match or exceed the homepage design quality across all pages.

⸻

PHASE 1 — “STOP POINT” AUDIT (MANDATORY FIRST)

Goal: Determine EXACTLY what the previous agent completed and where work stopped, before adding features.
	1.	Inventory the current project structure

	•	List routes/endpoints
	•	List templates/pages/components
	•	List nav/footer links and dropdown items
	•	Identify any broken routes (500) or missing templates

	2.	Create a Status Map
Produce a table in your response (for the user) with columns:

	•	Route
	•	Purpose
	•	Exists? (Y/N)
	•	Works? (Y/N)
	•	Template/component source
	•	Notes / missing sections

	3.	Identify prior agent stopping point
Explicitly state:

	•	“Previous agent completed: ____”
	•	“Previous agent stopped before: ____”
	•	“Next safe continuation step: ____”

✅ Only after you finish this audit may you build new pages/features.

⸻

PHASE 2 — LOCK THE PRODUCT MODEL (NO MIXING)

The platform has two divisions:

A) Cybersecurity Solutions (GEM)
	•	SOC Monitoring / Threat Monitoring
	•	Incident Response
	•	Compliance Management (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA, PCI)

B) Alliance Trust Realty Solutions (Powered Partner)
	•	Asset Recovery
	•	Federal Compliance (documentation, governance, regulated advisory scope)

Rules
	•	Cyber pages must NOT include real-estate sales language.
	•	Trust/asset pages must NOT use cybersecurity jargon.
	•	Shared pages (Home, About, Contact) may mention both — but in separate sections.

⸻

PHASE 3 — INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (CANONICAL)

Required Routes (Final Sitemap)

Core
	•	/ (Homepage) ✅ already strong
	•	/services (Solutions Hub — canonical)
	•	/news (Intelligence hub)
	•	/portfolio OR replace with /case-studies
	•	/qfs (must explain purpose)
	•	/about-us
	•	/contact-us (must have working form)
	•	/legal/privacy-policy
	•	/legal/terms-of-service
	•	/legal/cookie-policy

Services
	•	/services/threat-monitoring (or map existing /monitoring-threats to this)
	•	/services/incident-response
	•	/services/compliance-management
	•	/services/asset-recovery
	•	/services/federal-compliance

Redirect requirement

If /services-overview exists, it must redirect to /services.

⸻

PHASE 4 — DESIGN SYSTEM (MATCH CURRENT “A” QUALITY)

Visual Standard
	•	Maintain existing premium dark theme and typography
	•	Improve rhythm: spacing, hierarchy, legibility, consistency
	•	Avoid “template look” regressions

Conversion Standard
	•	One persistent primary CTA: Schedule Assessment
	•	Secondary CTA: Talk to an Expert
	•	Clear trust signals: certifications, metrics, testimonials, “powered by” statement

⸻

PHASE 5 — PAGES TO BUILD (IN ORDER)

Build in this order so the site remains coherent throughout:

1) /services (Solutions Hub)

Must include two clearly separated sections:
	•	Cybersecurity Solutions
	•	Alliance Trust Realty Solutions

Each card includes:
	•	1-line value prop
	•	3–6 feature bullets
	•	1 metric proof point
	•	CTA “Learn more”

2) Service Detail Pages (5 total)

Use a consistent enterprise template:
	•	Hero: headline + subheadline + metrics + CTA
	•	“What’s included” (clear scope)
	•	“How it works” (workflow)
	•	“Use cases” (by industry)
	•	“Governance & compliance” section
	•	Pricing approach (transparent or “custom based on…”)
	•	CTA block

3) /contact-us with WORKING FORM

Must include:
	•	Validations (required fields, message length)
	•	Success/error states
	•	Send email notification to admin
	•	Send confirmation email to user
	•	Service Interest dropdown includes both divisions

4) /news Intelligence Hub
	•	Featured article
	•	Grid of posts
	•	Filters
	•	Newsletter signup

5) /about-us

Must include:
	•	Mission
	•	Leadership/team
	•	Certifications & trust markers
	•	Partnerships (Alliance Trust Realty highlighted cleanly)

6) /case-studies (recommended over portfolio)
	•	Filterable grid
	•	2–3 detailed case pages

7) Legal pages
	•	Clean formatting, TOC anchors, last updated date

⸻

PHASE 6 — BACKEND REQUIREMENTS (CHOOSE STACK-CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION)

Before coding APIs, detect the stack:

If Flask/Jinja (likely):
	•	Use POST /api/contact, POST /api/newsletter, POST /api/assessment
	•	Implement SMTP via environment variables
	•	Add server-side validation + CSRF protection (if forms are server-rendered)

If Next.js:
	•	Use app/api/*/route.ts
	•	Use nodemailer (correct transporter creation: createTransport, not createTransporter)

Do not implement Next.js routes inside a Flask project. Detect first.

⸻

PHASE 7 — PERFORMANCE & QUALITY BAR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	•	Optimize images (WebP)
	•	Avoid heavy JS
	•	Keep animations subtle
	•	Mobile-first verification
	•	No broken links, no duplicate services, no traceable deprecated endpoints

⸻

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIRED FROM AGENT EACH RUN

Every run must end with:
	1.	Completed changes
	2.	Files changed
	3.	Routes added/modified
	4.	Tests performed (URLs checked)
	5.	Next actions

⸻

EXTRA: “WORKFORCE / WORKFLOW” PROOF (NEW REQUIREMENT)

Add a section on relevant pages that demonstrates operational maturity:
	•	Cyber: escalation steps, analyst oversight, response timeline, reporting cadence
	•	Trust: intake → verification → documentation → stakeholder updates → closure reporting

This must be written as real operational workflow, not marketing fluff.

⸻

STOP CONDITIONS (TO PREVENT REGRESSIONS)

Do NOT:
	•	Replace the entire theme with a generic template
	•	Add unrelated services
	•	Mix cyber and trust language within the same service page
	•	Break existing working pages while adding new ones

⸻

FINAL TASK

Start with the Phase 1 audit. Do not code new features until the audit is complete and the stop point is identified.

⸻

Quick note (important)

Your prompt you pasted includes Next.js API route examples, but your project so far has strongly resembled Flask/Jinja templates. The prompt above forces the agent to detect the stack first, so you don’t get mismatched code again.

If you want, I can also produce:
	•	a Flask-only version of the API routes (contact/newsletter/assessment) with SMTP env vars, validation, and templates, or
	•	a Next-only version with correct nodemailer usage and form wiring.

Just tell me which stack your new project is using.
