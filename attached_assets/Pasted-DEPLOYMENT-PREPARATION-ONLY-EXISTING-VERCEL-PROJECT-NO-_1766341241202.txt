DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION ONLY — EXISTING VERCEL PROJECT (NO LIVE CONFIGURATION YET)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINT
Deployment must be FULLY SET UP and READY, but MUST NOT be finalized,
activated, or pushed live until ALL remaining websites/projects are completed.

This is a PREPARATION-ONLY phase.
Do NOT execute a live deploy.
Do NOT bind production configuration.
Do NOT update the live Vercel project yet.

Stay within Fast Mode. No Autonomous Mode requests.

================================
GOAL
================================
Prepare the system so it can later deploy to an EXISTING Vercel project
with a single command, once all projects are ready to be added.

================================
STEP 1 — FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT READINESS
================================
1) Identify the correct frontend directory (existing structure):
   - Prefer /apps/web if present
   - Otherwise, use the current active frontend directory

2) Ensure frontend build works locally:
   - npm run build (or equivalent)
   - Fix build issues if any (small, safe changes only)

3) Ensure code is Vercel-compatible:
   - Framework auto-detection works
   - No hardcoded environment values
   - All config pulled from process.env

================================
STEP 2 — VERCEL PROJECT LINK (NO DEPLOY)
================================
Prepare linkage to an EXISTING Vercel project, but do NOT deploy.

Requirements:
- Assume these env vars MAY exist later:
  VERCEL_TOKEN
  VERCEL_ORG_ID
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

Actions:
- Create logic/scripts to support Vercel CLI linking
- Prepare `.vercel/project.json` template (DO NOT commit secrets)
- If project.json does not exist, generate it dynamically from env vars
- Do NOT run `vercel deploy`
- Do NOT run `vercel --prod`

================================
STEP 3 — CONFIGURATION & DOCUMENTATION
================================
1) Update `.env.example` to include:
   - VERCEL_TOKEN
   - VERCEL_ORG_ID
   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

2) Update `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with a clear section:
   "Deferred Vercel Deployment (Existing Project)"

Include:
- Explanation that deployment is intentionally deferred
- Exact commands that WILL be run later:
  npx vercel --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes
  npx vercel --prod --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --yes
- Preconditions checklist:
  - All projects added
  - Final UI verified
  - Environment variables set

================================
STEP 4 — SAFETY GUARANTEES
================================
- No live environment changes
- No production deploy
- No Vercel project creation
- No breaking changes to existing GEM runtime

================================
STATE CONFIRMATION
================================
After completing this task, report:
- "Vercel deployment fully prepared but intentionally not executed"
- Frontend build status (pass/fail)
- Readiness level (READY / BLOCKED_BY_CREDENTIALS)

Log results in:
- /docs/EXECUTION_LOG.md

================================
END CONDITION
================================
Stop after preparation is complete.
Do NOT proceed to live deployment.
Wait for explicit future instruction to activate deployment.

Proceed now.
