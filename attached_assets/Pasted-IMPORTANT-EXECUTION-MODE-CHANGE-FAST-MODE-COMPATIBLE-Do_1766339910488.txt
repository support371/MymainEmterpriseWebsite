IMPORTANT: EXECUTION MODE CHANGE — FAST MODE COMPATIBLE

Do NOT request Autonomous Mode.
Do NOT wait for upgrades.
Do NOT attempt full monorepo restructuring in a single step.

Switch to INCREMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE MODE.

Your role is now:
- Architect
- Incremental implementer
- Verifier

NOT a full refactor executor in one pass.

OBJECTIVE
Evolve the existing GEM Enterprises codebase into ForgeOps OmniCloud
using SMALL, FAST-MODE-SAFE vertical slices.

RULES
1. Preserve all existing functionality at all times.
2. No large repo-wide restructures.
3. No multi-service explosions in one step.
4. Each step must be small, testable, and reversible.
5. Never ask for approvals.
6. Never block on missing credentials.
7. Scaffold first, integrate later.

EXECUTION STRATEGY (MANDATORY)
Proceed in the following incremental slices. Complete each slice fully
before moving to the next.

SLICE 1 — FOUNDATION HARDENING
- Add Org and Project models alongside existing models
- Introduce minimal RBAC enforcement (Owner/Admin/Viewer)
- Add an append-only AuditEvent model
- Wire audit logging into existing request lifecycle
- No UI overhaul yet

SLICE 2 — AGENT RUN SKELETON
- Introduce AgentRun table and status lifecycle
- Implement Intake → Plan → Execute → Report as no-op placeholders
- Persist task graphs as JSON (no orchestration yet)
- Add execution logging to /docs/EXECUTION_LOG.md

SLICE 3 — CONNECTOR INTERFACES (NO REAL CALLS)
- Define connector interfaces only:
  GitHubConnector
  VercelConnector
  CloudflareConnector
  OpenAIConnector
  GeminiConnector
  DockerConnector
- Stub implementations that log intent instead of executing
- Add configuration schemas and .env.example entries

SLICE 4 — DEPLOYMENT SCAFFOLDING
- Add Dockerfile(s) without breaking existing runtime
- Add docker-compose.yml for local parity
- Do NOT migrate production yet
- Validate container build locally

SLICE 5 — CI SAFETY NET
- Add lint and basic unit test execution
- Add secret scan placeholder
- Ensure CI does not fail existing workflows

SLICE 6 — FRONTEND EXTENSION (MINIMAL)
- Add ForgeOps dashboard views incrementally
- Do not rewrite the existing UI
- Extend, don’t replace

SLICE 7 — OPTIONAL REAL INTEGRATIONS
- Only if credentials exist:
  - Enable OpenAI or Gemini calls
  - Enable GitHub or Vercel deploy hooks
- Otherwise leave stubs documented

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
At every slice:
- Code changes committed
- Existing app still runs
- Execution log updated with:
  - What changed
  - Why
  - How verified
  - What’s next

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS
- No full monorepo migration
- No fast-mode-breaking refactors
- No autonomous-mode requests
- No “big bang” architecture changes

Proceed immediately with SLICE 1.
