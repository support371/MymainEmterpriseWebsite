BACKEND SERVICES — ENTERPRISE-GRADE CONFIGURATION & ACTIVATION (NO FRONTEND GO-LIVE)

OBJECTIVE
All backend applications, services, and servers MUST be:
- Fully configured
- Actively running
- Enterprise-grade in quality and reliability
- Ready to serve traffic through the intended redirect/base URL

Frontend deployment remains deferred.
Backend services MUST be live, stable, and reachable.

================================
SCOPE
================================
This applies to ALL backend components, including but not limited to:
- API service
- Worker / background job processors
- Agent orchestration engine
- Integration connectors
- Auth, RBAC, audit logging subsystems
- Data persistence and queues

================================
ENTERPRISE-GRADE REQUIREMENTS
================================

1) SERVICE ACTIVATION
- All backend services must start successfully on boot
- No placeholder or disabled services
- No mock servers for core runtime paths
- Services must be resilient to missing optional integrations

2) ROUTING & REDIRECT BASE
- Backend must be bound to the intended base URL / redirect path
- All APIs must resolve correctly under that base (no hardcoded localhost paths)
- Health checks must be reachable at:
  /health or /status
- API base paths must be documented clearly

3) CONFIGURATION STANDARDS
- Environment-based configuration only
- No hardcoded secrets or endpoints
- Production-safe defaults
- Graceful handling of missing credentials:
  - Log warnings
  - Do not crash services
  - Mark integrations as inactive

4) ENTERPRISE QUALITY BAR
- Structured logging (JSON or consistent format)
- Clear startup logs indicating:
  - service name
  - version
  - environment
- RBAC enforced at API boundaries
- Audit events emitted for:
  - auth actions
  - agent runs
  - configuration changes
- Background jobs must be idempotent and retry-safe

5) INFRASTRUCTURE READINESS
- Docker containers must build and run cleanly
- docker-compose must bring up:
  - API
  - worker
  - database
  - queue
- No orphaned services
- Ports and dependencies explicitly defined

================================
DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY)
================================
Update or create the following:
- /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
  - Backend service overview
  - Runtime responsibilities
- /docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
  - Backend deployment section
  - Redirect/base URL explanation
- /docs/EXECUTION_LOG.md
  - What services were activated
  - How they were verified
  - Current operational state

================================
VALIDATION
================================
Confirm and log:
- All backend services are running
- API responds under intended base path
- Health endpoints return success
- Existing GEM functionality remains intact
- ForgeOps backend foundation is active and stable

================================
CONSTRAINTS
================================
- Do NOT deploy or update the frontend
- Do NOT modify the live Vercel project
- Do NOT request Autonomous Mode
- Do NOT introduce breaking changes

================================
END STATE
================================
Backend system is:
- Enterprise-grade
- Fully active
- Properly routed
- Ready to support multiple frontend projects later

Proceed immediately.
