This unit is reserved for Bitcoin investment–related logic and configuration.

Scope:
- Bitcoin-specific investment strategy logic
- Integration points for market data, execution, and reporting
- Configuration and environment variables specific to Bitcoin operations
- Risk controls, constraints, and safeguards for automated or assisted investment workflows

Non-Scope (explicitly excluded for now):
- General portfolio logic
- Other asset classes
- UI or frontend components

Status:
This is an intentionally minimal placeholder. Implementation will be added incrementally once architecture, compliance, and risk parameters are finalized.

Assumptions:
- Treated as a high-risk, production-grade financial component
- Designed to be modular, isolated, and auditable
- Must integrate cleanly with the broader repository without tight coupling
